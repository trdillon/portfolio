# Tim Dillon Portfolio

![ReactJS Resume Website](readme.jpg?raw=true "ReactJS Resume Website")

### <a href="http://itsdits.com/">Live Version</a> 

## Description

This is my personal portfolio/resume website built with React. 
I made this site to create a platform to share my personal projects and give visitors a glimpse of what I can do.

## Features

I used <a href="https://www.emailjs.com/">EmailJS</a> to handle SMTP relay for the contact form.

I also used the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/rest">GitHub REST API</a>
to create the commits feed in the Latest Work section.
